--2021.05.27--
1. Fix 05.27.2.
2 TODO: Inspect the C read count.

--2021.05.28--
1. Fix 05.27.2.
2. TODO: When the tail window finished, the entire row may not be finished if merge stage involved.
    -> Register each row in block, release when finished. When all be finished, then it can be merged.
    -> Maintain a block-wide tail & a window-wide tail. Register the block-wide piecies when assigning blocks,
       for each block check if it is the tail block of some rows, and tag the row finished. Every time
       a row in a block is finished, unregister the block from the row.
       If all blocks are removed from the row and the row is finished, then it can be merged.
3. TODO: col_s on the compressed format; while row_s on the dense format (contain empty rows).
